## What's the story?

I started my web-dev journey by leveraging online resources like the Odin project, Codecademy, and Harvard CS50 to establish a strong foundation in web development. I then Identified knowledge gaps and recognised the need for a structured learning environment to solidify my knowledge and accelerate skill development.

Therefore, I joined Makers bootcamp, consolidating previous learning and acquiring the necessary skills to contribute meaningfully to a software team.


These practical encounters have not only equipped me with the technical skills necessary for software development but have also instilled in me a passion for the iterative and creative aspects of coding.
